For such a food lover, it is really hard to keep money in pockets. So they are alike other food lovers in terms of using the money for food without keeping any track of how much money they got left. Recently they started a battle. Whoever wins gets a buffet treat from the other person. The game obviously with food. The person who spends more in a week for food wins the battle of food.

So, Jaber vai and Mukhtar vai thought it should come to an end, as contestants spend lots of their valuable time arguing on this issue instead of focusing on problem solving. As their programming skill is almost the same, it’s difficult to find out who is better through programming battle. So they have decided they will sit for a game named Shap-ludu, seems familiar? Yeah, we used to play Shap ludu a lot in our childhood.\n",

As a result, you came up with an idea; you have chosen one of your friends who will give you the live update of every move of each player. Can you determine who is the winner calculating each of their moves?\n",

    "g. If your piece lands on the head of a snake, you must slide down to the bottom of the snake.\n",

    "\n",
    "The next S lines contain description of the ladder: the ith of them contains two integers P and Q **(1 < P < 100 , P>Q)** denoting the start and end positions of a Snake, means if you come to the square numbered P, at the mouth of a snake, then you have to move your piece to the square numbered Q.\n",
